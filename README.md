* IntelliJ 
    * If you don't have it you can get it [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows).
* Or any other IDE that works for F#. <br />

The next step is to open your IDE, in this case we will work with Visual Studio. <br />

After you open Visual Studio you will need to create a new project. <br />
