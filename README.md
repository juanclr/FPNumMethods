# How to run the Golden Search Algortithm in F#
To run the Golden Search algorithm for F# you must have in your computer one of the next IDEs: <br />
* Visual Studio
    * If you don't have it you can get it [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).
* IntelliJ 
    * If you don't have it you can get it [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows).
* Or any other IDE that works for F#. <br />

The next step is to open your IDE, in this case we will work with Visual Studio. <br />

After you open Visual Studio you will need to create a 
![new project](C:\Users\chino\Desktop\npvs.png). <br />

Then you 
select Visual F# 
as your language, then 
select Console App.(.Net Core).<br />
Name the project, in this case we will call it "Proyecto Final Metodos". <br />

It will open in the file Program.fs, delete the contents of the file and paste the code in there.<br />

Press the green play button to Run the code.
